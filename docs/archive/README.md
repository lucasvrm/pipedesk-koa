## When to Reference Archive

### ✅ Good Reasons to Look Here
- Understanding why a technical decision was made
- Researching how a migration was performed
- Learning about project evolution
- Audit trail for compliance
- Historical context for current features

### ❌ Bad Reasons to Look Here
- Finding current installation instructions → Use [/docs/getting-started/](../getting-started/)
- Understanding current features → Use [/docs/features/](../features/)
- Learning current architecture → Use [/docs/development/](../development/)
- Contributing to the project → Use [/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Archive Policy

### What Gets Archived
- Phase-specific documentation after phase completion
- Migration guides after successful migration
- Implementation reports after feature is stable
- Audit reports after review period
- Duplicate documentation after consolidation

### What Doesn't Get Archived
- Current feature documentation
- Active troubleshooting guides
- Contributing guidelines
- Security policies
- Current status documents
